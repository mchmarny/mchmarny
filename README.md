<p style="font-size: 1.30em; line-height: 150%;">My name is Mark Chmarny and this is my personal development space. I usually share my longer thoughts on my <a href="https://blog.chmarny.com">blog</a>, and the shorter ones on <a href="https://twitter.com/mchmarny">@mchmarny on Twitter</a> or <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@mchmarny">Mastodon</a>. Hope to see you there.</p>

Here are few of my recent projects:

* [s3cme](https://github.com/mchmarny/s3cme) template Go app repo with image build/publish pipelines, SBOM, and SLSA provenance using OIDC, KMS and Artifact Registry
* [disco](https://github.com/mchmarny/disco) utility for bulk image, license, package, and vulnerability discovery in containerize workloads on GCP. Includes CLI and Service with custom metrics and BigQuery data exports
* [cloudbuild demo](https://github.com/mchmarny/cloudbuild-demo) to bootstrap a full CI/CD pipeline on Google Cloud to demonstrate policy controls for container image provenance, and for GKE authorization based on attestation
* [artomator](https://github.com/mchmarny/artomator) automates creation of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) with Binary Authorization attestation for container images in Artifact Registry.
* [Repo activity monitoring CLI](https://github.com/mchmarny/dctl) to get aggregated view into PR, issue, and comment events with author's company affiliation
* [Reproducible OpenID Connect for GCP](https://github.com/mchmarny/oidc-for-gcp-using-terraform) to configure Github Workflow using Terraform to push images to GCR
* [Multi-region REST service](https://github.com/mchmarny/restme) to bootstrap a fully functional service on GCP using Terraform with a developer release pipeline
* [Kubernetes namespace operator](https://github.com/mchmarny/ns-label-operator/tree/main/chart) applies custom deployments when any namespace in your cluster is labeled with a specific keyword
