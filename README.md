<p style="font-size: 1.30em; line-height: 150%;">My name is Mark Chmarny and this is my personal development space. I usually share my longer thoughts on my <a href="https://blog.chmarny.com">blog</a>, and the shorter ones on <a href="https://twitter.com/mchmarny">@mchmarny on Twitter</a> or <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@mchmarny">Mastodon</a>.
