My name is Mark Chmarny and this is my personal development space. I usually share my longer thoughts at https://m.chmarny.com and the shorter ones on https://twitter.com/mchmarny. Hope to see you there.

Here are few of my recent projects:

* [Kubernetes namespace operator](https://github.com/mchmarny/ns-label-operator/tree/main/chart) applies custom deployments when any namespace in your cluster is labeled with a specific keyword
* [Hardening Dapr apps](https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-demos/tree/master/hardened) example of multi-microservice app with tightly controlled access to secrets, components, and service invocation identity validation
* [Scaling Kubernetes deployment](https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-demos/tree/master/autoscaling-on-queue#autoscaling-dapr-service-based-on-queue-depth) based on the depth of a message queue to relief back-pressure
* [Processing pipeline](https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-demos/tree/fanout-eventhubs/pipeline) combining Twitter and cognitive APIs with pub/subs and WebSocket app to monitor topic sentiment
* [Fan-out pattern](https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-demos/tree/master/fan-out#fan-out-demo) for "broadcasting" single message to multiple configurable types of targets (e.g. Redis PubSub, HTTP, gRPC)
* [Continuous deployment using GitHub actions](https://github.com/mchmarny/git-ops) simple pipeline for test, image, and deploy app onto Kubernetes cluster
