<p style="font-size: 1.30em; line-height: 150%;">My name is Mark Chmarny and this is my personal development space. I usually share my longer thoughts on my <a href="https://blog.chmarny.com">blog</a>, and the shorter ones on <a href="https://twitter.com/mchmarny">@mchmarny on Twitter</a> or <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@mchmarny">Mastodon</a>. Hope to see you there.</p>

Here are few of my recent projects:

* [Repo activity monitoring CLI](https://github.com/mchmarny/dctl) to get aggregated view into PR, issue, and comment events with author's company affiliation
* [Reproducible OpenID Connect for GCP](https://github.com/mchmarny/oidc-for-gcp-using-terraform) to configure Github Workflow using Terraform to push images to GCR
* [Multi-region REST service](https://github.com/mchmarny/restme) to bootstrap a fully functional service on GCP using Terraform with a developer release pipeline
* [Kubernetes namespace operator](https://github.com/mchmarny/ns-label-operator/tree/main/chart) applies custom deployments when any namespace in your cluster is labeled with a specific keyword
* [Hardening Dapr apps](https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-demos/tree/master/hardened) example of multi-microservice app with tightly controlled access to secrets, components, and service invocation identity validation
* [Scaling Kubernetes deployment](https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-demos/tree/master/autoscaling-on-queue#autoscaling-dapr-service-based-on-queue-depth) based on the depth of a message queue to relief back-pressure
* [Fan-out pattern](https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-demos/tree/master/fan-out#fan-out-demo) for "broadcasting" single message to multiple configurable types of targets (e.g. Redis PubSub, HTTP, gRPC)
* [Continuous deployment using GitHub actions](https://github.com/mchmarny/git-ops) simple pipeline for test, image, and deploy app onto Kubernetes cluster
